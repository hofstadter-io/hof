[v0.6.2...v0.6.3](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/compare/v0.6.2...v0.6.3)

### hof gen adhoc mode

Adds flags to `hof gen` to support adhoc code gen,
so you do not need to setup a generator to use.

- `--template`/`-T` flag to specify templates, input data, schemas, and output files
- `--partial`/`-P` flag to support adhoc partial templates
- `--watch`/`-w` flag to suport watching globs and regenerating (also works for generators)
- `--as-module` flag turns your other flags into a reusable and sharable generator module
- `--init` flag bootstraps a new modular generator in the current directory

The `-T` flag has a flexible format so you can
supply multiple templates and control the data.
It lets you specify the mapping from template
to input & schema, to output filepath.

```
hof gen data.cue -T template.txt
hof gen data.yaml schema.cue -T template.txt > output.txt
```

See the following to learn more

### Other

- added `dict` to template helpers to create maps, useful for passing more than one arg to a partial template
- added `pascal` template helper for string casing
- load data with CUE code, more inline with `cue`
- (bug) remove some shell completetion hacks
- more tests, bugfixes, and dep updates
- some small changes to the datamodel schema, namely attribute change to prep for enhancemnts

## v0.6.4

[v0.6.3...v0.6.4](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/compare/v0.6.3...v0.6.4)

Bugfix and cleanup

- The `and` template helper was custom, wrong, and needed to be removed. This is the primary reason for the release.
- Removed many template helpers which overrode or duplicated Go's, or did not make sense or seemed unusual.
- Add newline when writing generator outputs, ending on a curly brace seemed odd.
- Update almost all deps, remove some others, need Go 1.17 to go out of fasion before rest can be... generics and breaking changes in deps...


## v0.6.5

[v0.6.4...v0.6.5](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/compare/v0.6.4...v0.6.5)

Introduces `hof fmt` to format code, in a beta state

- used during code gen, because we need this for diff3 correctness
- subcommand for formatting arbitrary files and managing containers
- adds `prettier` and `black` formatters to expand languages

Changes:

- update a number of version used during init of various things (mods & gens)
- `lookup` template helper now supports OpenAPI refs `#/path/to/thing`
- fix template path resolving when in gen is run in a subdir
- fixes issue when same outdir is used, with the same gen, from different locations
- shadow dir moved to be next to cue.mod, so that one can gen from any directory
- shadow dir updated to reflect path from CUE mod root output, use this as the path
- Static Files now support diff3 for user additions


## v0.6.6

[v0.6.5...v0.6.6](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/compare/v0.6.5...v0.6.6)

Fixes several bugs and re-adds telemetry with proper user controls.


## v0.6.7

[v0.6.6...v0.6.7](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/compare/v0.6.6...v0.6.7)

Introduces `hof create` to as a "npm create-react-app" for anything.
Easy bootstrap or add files to an existing project from any remote repository.

- essentially a generator with `Create` field to get inputs from user.
- configure an interactive prompt and input schema, user can also use flags to fill prompt
- adds a new `hof create <repo>` which fetches and prompts user for starting input
- adds `Create` schema and includes in generators
- add schema and code for implementing an input prompt
- works with remote repo, and also locally for directories
- makes it easy for you to provide one-line setup instructions for your own generators

To learn more about `hof create`, see
[docs/getting-started/create](https://docs.hofstadter.io/getting-started/create/).


Other changes:

- remove modder name from mod cache, flattening because they are always a git repo at a tag
- use cache dir for remote repositories
- enable symlinks for local, replaced, cue dependencies
- remove old or unused code
- fix and enable more formatters
- improve docker images
- improve tests & CI
- several bug fixes and edge case handling
