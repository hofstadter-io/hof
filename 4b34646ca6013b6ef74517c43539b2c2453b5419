{"timestamp":"1687901965","author":"verdverm","description":"@andrewhare My PR was merged, this still needs rebasing.\r\n\r\nI've also been working on some gcloud+packer+dagger on the `more-dagger` branch. I hit a point where nerdctl in docker-in-dagger was not working and went down this path. Now that I have, I may also be able to get nerdctl working in dagger more directly, tbd.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, there are 4 VM images for testing (`gcloud compute images list --no-standard-images`) this PR. It would be good to automate this testing, even if it runs outside of CI (GHA) for now.\r\n\r\nI think the docker one does not have users assigned to the docker group by default, so sudo is need, which is one thing we want to test and say \"set yourself up with sudoless docker by...\", I think nerdctl is the same way.\r\n\r\nnerdctl-rootless and podman do not have this issue"}
