# hof-lang

A framework for declarative programming
through DSLs, higher-level designs,
and polyglot generators.

- __Designs__ are written in DSLs.
- __DSLs__ are the spec of contract between the designs and generators.
- __Generators__ implement a DSL in one or more languages or technologies.

There are designs, DSLs, and generators for:

- Full-stack GraphQL webapps
- CLIs that run anywhere
- REST APIs and microservices
- Kubernetes Operators

Create a full hof-stack for just about anything
or import, extend, and customize the growing library
of designs, DSLs, and generators.
