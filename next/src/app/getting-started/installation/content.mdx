## Opting out of telemetry

We collect a few metrics to help us understand basic usage.

1. Which command is run, never the arguments or flags
2. OS & arch
3. the `hof` version

[link to code](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/blob/_dev/cmd/hof/ga/ga.go#L153)

To opt out of telemetry, set `HOF_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`

Long term, we will move to the Go strategy, which
uses a probability based method for reducing metrics even further,
i.e to collect enough for statistical 
significance and much more focused to the questions at hand.
