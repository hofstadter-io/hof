This has removed the need to recurse and inject the history, rather just filling the root datamodel once and the CUE references now pick up the changes!\r\n\r\nNew process:\r\n1. Runtime.LoadAllCUE\r\n2. Find all interesting hof.Node\r\n3. [loop datamodels: decode, enrich with history]\r\n4. Fill datamodels back into Runtime.Value\r\n5. [loop generators: update value, decode]\r\n6. All is good!\r\n\r\n\r\n# changing $hof -\u003e #hof","baseCommit":"d283b0d3da49b41bbbefab052f9d38ae855bd250"}
