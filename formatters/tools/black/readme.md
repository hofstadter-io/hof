# Black - Python formatter

Black is an [open-source](https://github.com/psf/black) Python code formatter by [@ambv](https://github.com/ambv).

This is Black wrapped in Flask so we can save on startup time.

There seem to be issues with pipenv arm64 images that can be used on M1/2 and other arm systems
