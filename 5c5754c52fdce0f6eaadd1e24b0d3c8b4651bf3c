{"timestamp":"1629306942","author":"verdverm","description":"@b4nst, Difficulty running `hof gen` for this repo is likely more about the replace directives (which is bad practice on my part). You should be able to `hof mod vendor cue \u0026\u0026 hof gen` from a fresh clone, but today you would have to place the modules in the expected locations for vendoring.\r\n\r\nw.r.t. the other PR, it would actually be helpful for you to checkout that branch and test it. I've changed the logic and may have broken your desired setup / workflow. This would be the most helpful thing right now.\r\n\r\nMoving the docs over there SGTM, you could in theory target that branch with a PR. I'm planning on adding mod(der) docs to the website as well, so there is a larger effort and I'd like to make sure there is consistency between the two. "}
