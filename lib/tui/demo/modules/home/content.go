const homeContent = `Welcome to [lime]Vermui[white], the crypto-currency terminal and platform.


If this is your first time here,


1. Press [green]Ctrl-<space>[white] to get to the [yellow]command box[white] above.
   There are many quick commands for moving around and making things happen.

      Enter '[teal]help[white] [red][topic[][white]' above for the help system.
      This also works for the documentation system, use '[teal]docs[white] [red][topic[][white]'.

   Try entering:

      [teal]home[white], [teal]help[white], or [teal]demo[white] with an optional arg:[red]<name>[white].


2. There are many [green]<alt>-{key}[white] / [green]M-{key}[white] shortcuts, some are global others are contextual.
   Explore the help system and the documentation. For starters:

      [green]Ctrl-<key>[white] are global and [green]M-<key>[white] are contextual, generally speaking.
      [green]M-s[white] and [green]M-S[white] are different. The second is [green]<alt>-<shift>-s[white].

      You can move around within components using [green]<arrows>[white], [green]<page-up/down>[white], and [green]<home>/<end>[white].
      [green]<tab>[white] and '[green]<backtab>[white]' (tick) will navigate within forms.
      There are many other [green]contextual M-n ...[white] sub-navigations as well.

      [green]<enter>[white] will submit commands, forms, and actions.
      [green]<escape>[white] will cancel or get you out of things.

      [green]Ctrl-<space>[white] will activate the [yellow]command box[white].
      [green]Ctrl-l[white] will show or hide the [red]developer console[white].
      [green]Ctrl-e[white] will show or hide the [red]error console[white].
      [green]Ctrl-a[white] will focus the main content.
      [green]Ctrl-c[white] will exit [lime]VermUI[white].

    These are contextual standards:
      [green]M-h[white] and [M-d[white] will quick show contextual [green]help[white] and [green]documentation[white].
      [green]M-a[white] is for the default contextual action. The default also has a specific key in most cases.
      [green]M-s[white] is for contextual [green]settings[white] and configuration.
      [green]M-n[white] is for contextual [green]navigation[white]. There are often secondary key inputs with navigation.


3. You will see colored words around. These are contextual and linked elements.
   They can be [teal]commands[white], [teal]quicknavs[white], [red]topics[white], [red]arguments[white], and specialized in a [yellow]module[white].
   The documentation and help systems have details throughout.

   Quick Legend:
      [teal]cyan links[white] are shortcodes that are the first entry in the command box.
      [yellow]yellow links[white] are modules, usually the longform name of a command and/or quicknav.
      [red]red links[white] are topics, often tied to quicknavs or commands as arguments.
      [green]green links[white] are custom and contextual. Usually for making something stand out.




                                             Have fun and be safe!   - The [lime]VermUI[white] Team
