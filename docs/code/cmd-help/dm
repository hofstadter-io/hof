Data models are values or objects used in many hof processes and modules.
The "datamodel" command helps you manage them and track their change history.
At their core, they represent the models that make up your application.
The intention is to define a data model for your entire application once,
then use this source of truth to generate code from database to server to client.

Hof's schema for datamodels is minimal and flexible, allowing you to define the
shape based on your application. You can have multiple datamodels as well.
You can also control and where and how history should be tracked. This history
is included during code generation so that database migrations and functions
for converting between versions can be created.

# Examples Datamodels

-- config.cue --
package datamodel

import (
	"github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/schema/dm"
	"github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/schema/dm/fields"
)

// Track an entire oject
Config: dm.Object & {

	host: fields.String & { Default: "8080" }

	database: {
		host:   fields.String
		port:   fields.String
		dbconn: fields.String
	}
}

-- database.cue --
package datamodel

import (
	"github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/schema/dm/sql"
	"github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/schema/dm/fields"
)

// Traditional database model which maps onto tables & columns
Datamodel: sql.Datamodel & {
	// implied through definition, duplicated here for example clarity
	$hof: metadata: {
		id:   "datamodel-abc123"
		name: "MyDatamodel"
	}

	Models: {
		User: {
			Fields: {
				ID:        fields.UUID
				CreatedAt: fields.Datetime
				UpdatedAt: fields.Datetime
				DeletedAt: fields.Datetime

				email:    fields.Email
				username: fields.String
				password: fields.Password
				verified: fields.Bool
				active:   fields.Bool

				persona: fields.Enum & {
					Vals: ["guest", "user", "admin", "owner"]
					Default: "user"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

# Example Usage   (dm is short for datamodel)

  $ hof dm list   (print known data models)
  NAME         TYPE       VERSION  STATUS  ID
  Config       object     -        ok      Config
  MyDatamodel  datamodel  -        ok      datamodel-abc123

  $ hof dm tree   (print the structure of the datamodels)

  $ hof dm diff   (prints a tree based diff of the datamodel)

  $ hof dm checkpoint -m "a message about this checkpoint"

  $ hof dm log    (prints the log of changes from latest to oldest)

  You can also use the -d & -e flags to subselect datamodels and nested values

Usage:
  hof datamodel [command]

Aliases:
  datamodel, dm

Available Commands:
  checkpoint  create a snapshot of the data model
  diff        show the current diff or between datamodel versions
  list        print available datamodels
  log         show the history for a datamodel
  tree        print datamodel structure as a tree

Flags:
  -d, --datamodel strings   specify one or more datamodels to operate on
  -e, --expr strings        CUE paths to select outputs, depending on the command
  -h, --help                help for datamodel

Global Flags:
      --inject-env       inject all ENV VARs as default tag vars
  -p, --package string   the Cue package context to use during execution
  -q, --quiet            turn off output and assume defaults at prompts
