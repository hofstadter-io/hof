Data modeling is core in `hof` because
your data model is core to your applications.
They form the basis for input to code generation and
`hof` has a suite of utilities for working with them.
{{</lead>}}

The goal `hof` started with was to 

- write your data model in one place, as a source of truth
- automate the  of utilities 



enable scaffolding
of boilerplate code across the application stack and technologies.


You will be able to get

- enforce schemas
- checkpoint a history of changes
- database tables & automatic migrations


- command
- history & checkpointing
