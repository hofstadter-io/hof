Up until now, we have been generating Go code.
`hof` makes it easy to generate multiple languages
at the same time from the same designs and data models.

Throughout this section, we will generate a simple web client.
In addition to seeing multi-language code generation,
we will also see how to use static files and how
we can modularize even within a single module.

We will be using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs) for styling.

The full code for this section can be found on GitHub
[code/first-example/web-client](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof-docs/tree/main/code/first-example/web-client)
