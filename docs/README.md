# hof-docs

Documentation website for _Hofstadter.


### Running

You'll need a recent version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) __extended__ from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases. (make sure to get the "hugo_extended_..." version for your system)

On linux or codespaces:

```sh
make first
make run    of   make run.codespace
```

this will break on mac

You should now be able to edit pages live. Hugo will print a link for previewing.
