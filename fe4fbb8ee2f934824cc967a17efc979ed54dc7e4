Rewrite some of the auth logic, trying to add auth to requests when available, regardless of private repo or not. This is desirable so that API limits are greater (for example we have seen CI errors from hitting the API rate limiting with public only deps)\r\n2. Enable private module tests in CI\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] more private module tests\r\n    - [x] authentication methods\r\n    - [x] gitlab\r\n    - [x] plain git\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n    - [x] CLI docs\r\n    - [ ] website docs   \r\n    \r\n---\r\n\r\n- can we lookup auth per provider once and store in mem for reuse as we process the dep graph?"}
